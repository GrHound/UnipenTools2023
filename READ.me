This is a version of UpTools by the former Unipen Foundation and research groups at the University of Nijmegen and 
the University of Groningen. Imported by Lambert Schomaker. Main programming work by Lambert Schomaker & Louis Vuurpijl
with several contributions by others (Isabelle Guyon, Gerben Abbink) and student teams.

README
install  Install script
Unipen2eps  To make .eps postscript files from unipen data
Uplib       The library that is needed by the other tools
Upread2     Actually: upread3, the central program to extract words, characters etc. from a Unipen file
Upstat1     Simple exports from unipen
Upview      Crude X11 main program to visualize Unipen files

Contoursom2unipen   Very specific tool for visualizing Kohonen maps of usually contours of character images
                    which are translated to unipen format to be able to use UpTools tools on them.

bin/    Filled with binaries upon running the install script on a Linux.

This package now also contains experimental software for generating
images from Unipen files (upread3) for training modern image-based
handwriting recognizers. A brush is used to produce a quasi ink
deposit with a "raised cosine" which is flattened by raising
it to to the power 0.25. A good brush width is 5 or 7 for
this particular data.

The software does not have been tested extensively.

NOTE
Dear Qiao Yu,

I have forgotten to send a kind of "dtd" file which
belongs to the unipen software: unipen.def.

Before running upread2, two environment variables
need to be set:

UNIPEN_DEFINITION_FILE=/home/<your name>/unipen.def
UNIPEN_INCLUDE_PATH=". .INHERIT"

Sorry for this omission, I noticed it when I gave
the same distro to one of my students.

Best regards,
Lambert

upview

upview V3.03 March 1997 - L.Schomaker, L.Vuurpijl, G.Abbink  - NICI The Netherlands
Usage: 
   upview [-options] <wildspec of UniPen files>

Options:
    -p <number>:  PenDown pressure criterion, e.g., -p0 inks all p>0
    -c <number>:  number of columns in display, e.g., -c3
    -i <number>:  line thickness of Ink in X11 pixels, e.g., -i4
    -h <number>:  requested hierarchy level (differs per file), e.g., -h0 is top level

    -B:           biggest chunk size determines all scaling
    -S:           setup .X_DIM/.Y_DIM determines all scaling
Or: -O:           optimal scaling per chunk (periods and comma's are inflated)

    -Y:           multiply Y channel by -1
    -U:           also show .PENUP signal
    -V:           display (pseudo)velocity for digitizer assessment
    -f <file>:    the UNIPEN definition file (default=unipen.def)
    -W <width>:  (default=850)
    -H <height>: (default=770)
