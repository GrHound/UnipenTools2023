This package contains experimental software for generating
images from Unipen. A brush is used to produce a quasi ink
deposit with a "raised cosine" which is flattened by raising
it to to the power 0.25. A good brush width is 5 or 7 for
this particular data.

The software does not have been tested extensively.

NOTE
Dear Qiao Yu,

I have forgotten to send a kind of "dtd" file which
belongs to the unipen software: unipen.def.

Before running upread2, two environment variables
need to be set:

UNIPEN_DEFINITION_FILE=/home/<your name>/unipen.def
UNIPEN_INCLUDE_PATH=". .INHERIT"

Sorry for this omission, I noticed it when I gave
the same distro to one of my students.

Best regards,
Lambert
